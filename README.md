Protocol-7 is a standalone desktop application that provides blazing-fast, offline voice dictation. It integrates directly into your operating system to allow seamless, global voice-to-text with advanced AI grammar correction.

## Features
- **Cross-Platform Native**: Runs flawlessly on both Windows 10/11 and Linux (Wayland).
- **Global Hotkey**: Double-tap `Ctrl` to trigger dictation globally from anywhere in your OS. 
- **Auto-Paste**: Instantly pastes the transcribed text directly into your currently focused window (`pyautogui` on Windows, `wtype` on Wayland).
- **Local AI Engine**: Powered by `faster-whisper` with automatic hardware acceleration (CUDA fallback to CPU).
- **AI Grammar & Self-Correction**: Features a real-time LLM backend (Built-in LLaMA.cpp or remote Ollama Server) to correct grammar, fix phonetic typos, and apply vocal self-corrections on the fly.
- **Advanced Microphone Engine**: Automatically detects WASAPI/MME capabilities, deduplicates virtual inputs, and auto-negotiates sample rates for pristine audio capture.
- **Customizable UI**: Beautiful dark-mode settings built with `CustomTkinter` (Windows) and `GTK4` (Linux). Change themes, languages, translation targets, and AI prompts visually.

## Setup for Windows

1. Clone the repository:
   ```powershell
   git clone https://github.com/dcqwqc/protocol-7.git
   cd protocol-7
   ```
2. Install requirements:
   ```powershell
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the app:
   ```powershell
   python main.py
   ```
   *(Optional) You can right-click `create_shortcut.ps1` and select "Run with PowerShell" to generate a hidden `.vbs` shortcut that launches the app silently in the background.*

## Setup for Linux (Wayland)

1. Ensure you have the required dependencies: `python3`, `wtype`, `gtk4`, and `gtk4-layer-shell`.
2. Clone and run the universal install script (Debian/Ubuntu, Arch, Fedora):
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dcqwqc/protocol-7.git
   cd protocol-7
   ./install.sh
   ```
3. *Note: The install script adds your user to the `input` group to allow global hotkey detection via `evdev`. You may need to log out and log back in.*
4. Run the app:
   ```bash
   ./venv/bin/python main.py
   ```

## Usage
Once running, the app lives silently in your system tray. 
- **Double-tap `Ctrl`** to start dictating. A beautiful overlay visualizer will pop up at the bottom of your screen.
- **Double-tap `Ctrl` again** to stop. It will automatically process the audio and type it into your active window.

Right-click the tray icon (or run with `--settings`) to access the configuration menu, view live developer logs, and select your preferred microphone.

## Configuration & Custom Models
All model management is handled seamlessly within the Settings UI:
- **Whisper Models**: Choose from built-in models or input any HuggingFace Repo ID (e.g. `Systran/faster-whisper-large-v3`). 
- **Local LLM Models**: Select "Built-in (Llama.cpp)" and provide any GGUF filename and HuggingFace Repo.
- **Ollama**: Connect to a local or remote Ollama server and pull models dynamically.
- **AI System Prompt**: Fully rewrite and customize the exact prompt instructions the AI follows using the built-in text editor.
